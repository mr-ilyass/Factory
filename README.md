> simple explanation with example of Factory design pattern in java

## Purpose of Factory D.P

By the name we can guess it produces or creates something, in our case objects. 
Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern
it provides one of the best ways to create an object
it provides an interface / abstract class for creating objects in a superclass, 
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Usage of Factory Design Pattern

- when object creation is dynamic ‚Äì at run time we need to decide which object to be created
- when you don‚Äôt know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
- when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal components.
- when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them each time.
